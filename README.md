## What is VibeFlow?
VibeFlow is a terminal-first IDE that pairs real terminal sessions with a persistent context layer.
It tracks intent, lets you park thoughts, and makes it easy to resume your flow on any repo.

## Why it matters
- Context switching kills momentum; VibeFlow preserves it.
- Intent keeps sessions focused and explainable.
- Local-first design keeps your data on your machine.

## Core Features
- Multi-tab terminal workspace
- Live Context panel with intent + parked thoughts
- Session history with resume
- Read-only file explorer + preview
- Command dock for consistent, guided input
- Settings + data controls (delete session or repo context)

## UI Highlights
- Warp-style tabs and command dock
- Collapsible side panels
- Intent/parked thought micro-interactions
- Session resume and receipt flow
